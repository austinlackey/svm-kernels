# svm-kernels
Implementing Kernel's for Support Vector Machines (SVM) on Escherichia coli data.

## Tasks

- [ ] (a) Finish up your Python SVM code for multiclass classification without kernel.
- [ ] (b) Implement kernels in your own SVM code.
- [ ] (c) Implement SVM in sklearn.
- [ ] (d) Understand the functionality of various kernels for SVM.
- [ ] (e) Compare your own implementation of SVM and that in sklearn, with and without kernels, for binary and multiclass classifications.
- [ ] (f) Apply the methods you develop above to the classification problem. Quantify the accuracy of your classifications.
- [ ] (g) Wrap up the results and finish a project report with five or more pages (excluding your code).
